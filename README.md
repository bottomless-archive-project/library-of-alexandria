# Library of Alexandria

Library of Alexandria (LoA in short) is a project that aims to collect and archive documents from the internet.

In our modern age new text documents are born in a blink of an eye then (often just as quickly) disappear from the internet. We find it a noble task to save these documents for future generations.

This project aims to support this noble goal in a scalable way. We want to make the archival activity streamlined and easy to do even in a huge (Terabyte / Petabyte) scale. This way we hope that more and more people can start their own collection helping the archiving effort.

## Documentation

We have an extensive documentation for the applications suite! It is available in our [documentation page](https://bottomless-archive-project.github.io/library-of-alexandria.github.io/documentation/1.0.0/)!
