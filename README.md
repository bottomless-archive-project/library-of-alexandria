# Library of Alexandria

Library of Alexandria (LoA in short) is a project that aims to collect and archive documents from the internet.

In our modern age new text documents are born in a blink of an eye then (often just as quickly) disappear from the internet. We find it a noble task to save these documents for future generations.

This project aims to support this noble goal in a scalable way. We want to make the archival activity streamlined and easy to do even in a huge (Terabyte / Petabyte) scale. This way we hope that more and more people can start their own collection helping the archiving effort.

## Documentation

We have an extensive documentation for the application suite! It is available in our [documentation page](https://bottomless-archive-project.github.io/library-of-alexandria.github.io/documentation/)!

## Introduction video

We have an [introduction video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9EAxaWTtw0) to show the application in action. The example dataset shown in the video is **33 TB** in size with **30 million documents**.

## Discord

We have an official [Discord server](https://discord.gg/bK84Jc3zrB) to help people setting up the application and discussing possible/upcoming updates. Feel free to join.
