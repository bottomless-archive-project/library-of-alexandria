= Library of Alexandria

image::logo-background.png[align="center"]

Library of Alexandria (LoA in short) is a project that aims to collect and archive documents from the internet.

In our modern age new text documents are born in a blink of an eye then (often just as quickly) disappear from the internet. We find it a noble task to save these documents for future generations.

This project aims to support this noble goal in a scalable way. We want to make the archival activity streamlined and easy to do even in a huge (Terabyte / Petabyte) scale. This way we hope that more and more people can start their own collection helping the archiving effort.
