= Indexing

== Recommended hardware

Indexing should either be run on a different machine than collecting or the memory and disc requirements should be added together.

You can do the indexing on any machine that has sufficient memory requirements, but without a proper CPU, your indexing speed could be slow.

=== Indexing small amounts (1 - 25 million)

* **CPU**: http://www.cpu-world.com/CPUs/Zen/AMD-Ryzen%205%203600.html[AMD Ryzen 5 3600] or similar
* **Memory**: 64 GB
* **Disc space**: 256-1024 GB SSD

=== Indexing medium amounts (25 - 100 million)

* **CPU**: http://www.cpu-world.com/CPUs/Zen/AMD-Ryzen%207%203800X.html[AMD Ryzen 7 3800X] or similar
* **Memory**: 64 GB
* **Disc space**: 1-4 TB SSD

=== Indexing massive amounts (100 - 500+ million)

* **CPU**: http://www.cpu-world.com/CPUs/Zen/AMD-Ryzen%209%203950X.html[AMD Ryzen 9 3950X] or similar
* **Memory**: 16 GB memory for each 100 million documents + 32GB+ for the Indexer Application, the exact value depends on what parallelism level is being used
* **Disc space**: 4 TB SSD for each 100 million documents
