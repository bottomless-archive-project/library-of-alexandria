= System Requirements

It's important to mention the hardware requirements of collecting and handling documents. If you only want to gather a few million documents then that could be done on a home PC. However, if you want to collect & store a massive amount, then purpose-built hardware is necessary. Also, if you want to collect 24/7 then having a machine that doesn't consume a lot of power is recommended where electricity prices are high.

Collecting and indexing have quite different requirements as well, so we split the hardware requirements section into two separate chapters.

The requirements mentioned here could be built from used/commodity hardware if necessary to keep the prices low.
