= Running the Staging Application

You can download the <<Staging Application>> files at our https://github.com/bottomless-archive-project/library-of-alexandria/releases[release page]. Please take care to choose a non "pre-release" version!

After the download is complete run the application via the following command:

java -jar loa-staging-application-{release-number}.jar ...

In the place of the ... you should write the various parameters. For the available parameters check the parameter list under the <<Staging Application>>.
