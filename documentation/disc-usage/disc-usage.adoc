= Disc usage patterns

Because of it's distributed nature, the application might show some unusual disc usage patterns.
For example, every document is written 3 times to various media.
It _might_ be important to put these folders on different physical discs for performance or durability reasons.

This part of the documentation exists so users have a better understanding of what usage patterns they might expect for different applications/folders.

== Queue Data Directory

The *Queue Application's* *loa.queue.data-directory* is usually small is size.
The files in this folder are usually memory-mapped so any kind of generic SSD might work for this folder.
It stores the intermittent messaging between the applications.
This usually consist of the URLs to download, adn the metadata of the documents until they are moved into the vault.
Even when processing large amount of URLs or documents, the size of this folder should be under 50-100 GB.
For example, 200 million URLs in the downloader queue takes up around 30 GB of disk space.

== Temporary Stage Folders

The *Downloader Application, Vault Application, Beacon Application and Administrator Application* has its own stage directory, where files are downloaded temporarily, before they are getting verified and validated or processed further in any way.
It exists because we don't want to store every document that is under processing by the respective application in the memory.
For some documents, the app downloads 500 MBs, but it fails to validate in the first few bytes (PDFs are parsed from the end of the file).
In this case it is pointless and very wasteful to hold the whole document in memory.
Because of this, the files in this folder are very short-lived. They are deleted almost immediately after the downloading is finished.
