== Workflow

This application is responsible for reading out the document locations from the <<Queue Application>> and downloading its contents.

.Parameters
|===
| Parameter | Description

| **loa.queue.port**
| The port of the queue where the application should connect, and the document locations should be sent. *(Default value: 61616)*

| **loa.queue.host**
| The host of the queue where the application should connect, and the document locations should be sent. *(Default value: localhost)*

| **loa.stage.location**
| The location where the document files are first downloaded. After some validation and occasionally modification (compression etc) it is moved to the vault.

| **loa.database.host**
| The host location of the MongoDB database server. *(Default value: localhost)*

| **loa.database.port**
| The port open for the MongoDB database server. *(Default value: 27017)*

| **loa.database.no-cursor-timeout**
| Whenever the cursor objects created by the application should be able to timeout. Ideally you would set up the timeout on your MongoDB server (see: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/parameters/#param.cursorTimeoutMillis[cursorTimeoutMillis]) but because not everybody is a MongoDB expert, we disable timeouts by default. This could cause a couple of open cursors (so extra resource usage) on the MongoDB server when the application crashes for some reason and the cursors are not closed correctly. If you set the cursor timeout too low, then the application will crash if it is not able to process a batch of items under the provided timeout. *(Default value: true)*
