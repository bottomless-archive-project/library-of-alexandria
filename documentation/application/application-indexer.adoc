= Indexer Application

This application makes documents searchable by inserting them into an Elasticsearch cluster.

== Workflow

The application looks for documents that has the `DOWNLOADED` status and indexes them by sending them to the Elasticsearch cluster.

.Parameters
|===
| Parameter | Description

| **loa.database.host**
| The host location of the MongoDB database server. *(Default value: localhost)*

| **loa.database.port**
| The port open for the MongoDB database server. *(Default value: 27017)*

| **loa.database.no-cursor-timeout**
| Whenever the cursor objects created by the application should be able to timeout. Ideally you would set up the timeout on your MongoDB server (see: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/parameters/#param.cursorTimeoutMillis[cursorTimeoutMillis]) but because not everybody is a MongoDB expert, we disable timeouts by default. This could cause a couple of open cursors (so extra resource usage) on the MongoDB server when the application crashes for some reason, and the cursors are not closed correctly. If you set the cursor timeout too low, then the application will crash if it is not able to process a batch of items under the provided timeout. *(Default value: true)*

| **loa.vault.client.locations.{vault-name}.host**
| The IP address of the <<Vault Application>> with the provided name, to grab the documents for displaying. If you use more than one vault, you need to list all of them!

| **loa.vault.client.locations.{vault-name}.port**
| The port of the <<Vault Application>> with the provided name, to grab the documents for displaying. If you use more than one vault, you need to list all of them!

| **loa.indexer.database.host**
| The host of the Elasticsearch database.

| **loa.indexer.database.port**
| The port of the Elasticsearch database.

| **loa.indexer.concurrent-indexer-threads**
| On how many concurrent threads should the indexer run. The number of cores available in the host machine is a good rule of thumb for this property. *(Default value: 1)*
