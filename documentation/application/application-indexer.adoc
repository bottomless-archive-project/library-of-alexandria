.Parameters
|===
| Parameter | Description

| **loa.downloader.parallelism**
| How many documents should be indexed in parallel at any given time. If the value is set to 4, then the application tries to index 4 documents at the same time. *(Default value: 3)*

| **loa.downloader.batch-size**
| The amount of documents to index that the application queries with each round-trip to the database. If the cursor timeout error happens frequently, this parameter should be set to a lower value. This would change the application to do more frequent calls to the database, lowering the chance of a timeout. *(Default value: 10)*
