.Commands
|===
| Name | Description

| reindex
| This task will reset every document's status to `DOWNLOADED`. It is useful if a full reindex is needed via the Indexer Application.

| silent-compressor
| This command will go through every document in the database and ask the <<Vault Application>> to recompress them when the provided compression algorithm is not the same as provided.

| cleanup
| Removes every document with status `CORRUPT`. The documents will be removed from the <<Vault Application>> and the database too.

| recollect-corrupt-documents
| Tries to recollect every document with status `CORRUPT`. The document's `sourceLocations` variable stores the ids of the document locations where the document was collected from. This command will try to re-download the document from these source locations. If any of the downloads is successful, then the document's content will be replaced with non-corrupt data (effectively reconstructing the document). If all of the downloads fails, then the `CORRUPT` status will be kept.

| register-user
| Registers a user into the application suite. The `loa.command.register-user.name` and the `loa.command.register-user.password` parameters should be provided.
