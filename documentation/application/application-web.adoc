= Web Application

The Web Application provides access to the users to the indexed documents.

== Workflow

The application run queries on the Elasticsearch cluster and display the results. If the user wants to request a document, it will reach out to the <<Vault Application>> to download the requested document. The dashboard screen also uses the <<Queue Application>> to show how many messages are waiting for processing by the various applications.

.Parameters
|===
| Parameter | Description

| **loa.database.host**
| The host location of the MongoDB database server. *(Default value: localhost)*

| **loa.database.port**
| The port open for the MongoDB database server. *(Default value: 27017)*

| **loa.database.no-cursor-timeout**
| Whenever the cursor objects created by the application should be able to timeout. Ideally you would set up the timeout on your MongoDB server (see: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/parameters/#param.cursorTimeoutMillis[cursorTimeoutMillis]) but because not everybody is a MongoDB expert, we disable timeouts by default. This could cause a couple of open cursors (so extra resource usage) on the MongoDB server when the application crashes for some reason, and the cursors are not closed correctly. If you set the cursor timeout too low, then the application will crash if it is not able to process a batch of items under the provided timeout. *(Default value: true)*

| **loa.queue.host**
| The ip address of the Queue Application. *(Default value: localhost)*

| **loa.queue.port**
| The port where the Queue Application is listening for new connections. *(Default value: 61616)*

| **loa.vault.client.locations.{vault-name}.host**
| The IP address of the <<Vault Application>> with the provided name, to grab the documents for displaying. If you use more than one vault, you need to list all of them!

| **loa.vault.client.locations.{vault-name}.port**
| The port of the <<Vault Application>> with the provided name, to grab the documents for displaying. If you use more than one vault, you need to list all of them!

| **loa.indexer.database.host**
| The host of the Elasticsearch database.

| **loa.indexer.database.port**
| The port of the Elasticsearch database.

== API endpoints

The Web Application is a bit special compared to the others, because it exposes web endpoints as well. These endpoints are mostly used by the UI, but can be used as an API as well if necessary.

=== General endpoints

...

=== Debug endpoints

.APIs
|===
| API | Description

| **/document/\{documentId\}/debug**
| Returns all the data that is available about the document in the database. This endpoint is created mainly because it is hard to search documents by id in MongoDB when the id is represented in binary.
