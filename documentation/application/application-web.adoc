= Web Application

The Web Application provides access to the users to the indexed documents.

== Workflow

The application run queries on the Elasticsearch cluster and display the results. If the user wants to request a document, it will reach out to the <<Vault Application>> to download the requested document. The dashboard screen also uses the <<Queue Application>> to show how many messages are waiting for processing by the various applications.

== API endpoints

The Web Application is a bit special compared to the others, because it exposes web endpoints as well. These endpoints are mostly used by the UI, but can be used as an API as well if necessary.

=== General endpoints

=== Debug endpoints

.APIs

| API | Description
